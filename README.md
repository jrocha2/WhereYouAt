WhereYouAt is a social media app that allows college students to share with their friends what they are doing when they go out. Users can also view trends via tableview and map to get a general idea of how many people are at certain locations/events. With the help of Firebase, features include: Google authentication, friend requests, real-time event updates, and much more. The current version is built with the Notre Dame campus in mind.
